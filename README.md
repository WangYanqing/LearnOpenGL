Exercises when learning openGL

This is a pretty personal repository, the initial purpose is to record the exercises of learning OpenGL. (Github is a good place to store code, so that I can access and modify it from anywhere).

Recording the practices during studying the materials from the website [learnopengl-cn](https://learnopengl-cn.readthedocs.io/zh/latest/). This site helps me understanding the foundamental mechanism of open-gl, is very good learning material.
